Image Building
==============

This directory contains all of the build tooling for LociStack. At a
minimum, you need build the LociStack images using the makefile in the
``locistack`` directory.

If you aren't uaing a pre-built set of images, you must first build a set
of base loci images using the makefile in the ``loci`` directory.

The ``images`` directory includes some tooling for creating virtual or
bare metal images.
